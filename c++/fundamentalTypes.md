# C++ Var types

---

- Integers
  - short, long, int
- Real numbers
  - float, double
- character
  - char (''), unsigned char ("")
- boolean
  - bool

Sometimes typing out specific type of var is at times impossible. Therefore, `auto` exists. What it does is:

- Asks compiler to deduce the type
- The variable is still strongly typed, we just didn't have to type it ourselves.
  - Important to note that cannot change the type later, still 'strongly' typed.
- Auto is useful for ugly declarations
