# Entity Framework

---

Entity Framework is a ORM (Object Relational Mapping).

- ORM is a technique that lets you query and manipulate data from a database using an object-oriented paradigm.
  - This allows working with objects rather than writting SQL statements

Relational models and Object models don't really work well together.

| A relational database represents data in a tabular form vs An interconnected object graph | It takes care of mapping between tabular format and the object graph      |

## Entity Framework Core

It is a lightweight, extensible, and x-platform version of Entity Framework and recommended for .Net Core apps.

It supports a variety of databases, even non-relational ones, it is a code-first or database-first approach.
