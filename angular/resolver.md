# Resolver

- A **Resolver** in Angular is a service that pre-fetches data before a route is activated, ensuring that the necessary data is available when the route is accessed.
  - This is particularly useful for loading important data that a component depends on, thereby enhancing user experience by avoiding loading indicators or incomplete views.

## Benefits of using resolvers:
  - **Improved user experience:** Data is loaded before the component is rendered, avoiding blank pages and loading spinners.
  - **Better code organization:** Data fetching logic is separated from the component, making it more maintainable and reusable.
  - **Easier testing:** Resolvers can be easily unit tested in isolation.

## Creating resolver service

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { Resolve, ActivatedRouteSnapshot, RouterStateSnapshot } from '@angular/router';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
import { YourDataService } from './your-data.service'; // Your data fetching service

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class YourDataResolver implements Resolve<any> {

  constructor(private dataService: YourDataService) {}

  resolve(route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot, state: RouterStateSnapshot): Observable<any> {
    return this.dataService.fetchData(); // Call your data fetching method
  }
}
```

## Configuring the route

```typescript
import { Routes } from '@angular/router';
import { YourComponent } from './your.component';
import { YourDataResolver } from './your-data.resolver';

const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'your-route',
    component: YourComponent,
    resolve: {
      data: YourDataResolver
    }
  }
];
```

## Access the resolved data in the component:

```typescript
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-your-component',
  templateUrl: './your-component.html'
})
export class YourComponent implements OnInit {

  data: any;

  constructor(private route: ActivatedRoute) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.data = this.route.snapshot.data['data']; // Access the resolved data
  }
}
```
