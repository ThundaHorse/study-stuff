# Angular lifecycle hooks

Lifecycle hooks are methods that allow you to tap into key moments in a component's lifecycle

- `ngOnInit()`: Called once component's data-bound properties have been initialized
- `ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges)`: Called whenever one or more data-bound input properties change
- `ngDoCheck()`: Called during every change detection run
  - Allows you to implement your own change detection
- `ngAfterContentInit()`: Called once Angular projects external content into the component's view.
- `ngAfterContentChecked()`: Called after every check of projected content.
- `ngAfterViewInit()`: Called **_once_** after the component's view (and child views) has been initialized
- `ngAfterViewChecked()`: Called after every check of the component's view (and child views)
- `ngOnDestroy()`: Called just before Angular destroys the component, allowing you to clean up resources

## Responding to lifecycle events

- Respond to events in the lifecycle of a component or directive by implementing one or more of the lifecycle hook interfaces in the Angular core library.
- The hooks give you the opportunity to act on a component or directive instance at the appropriate moment, as Angular creates, updates, or destroys that instance.
- Each interface defines the prototype for a single hook method, whose name is the interface name prefixed with `ng`

| **Hook method**             | **Purpose**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | **Timing**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **ngOnInit()**              | Initialize the directive or component after Angular first displays the data-bound properties and sets the directive or component's input properties. See details in Initializing a component or directive in this document.                                                                                            | Called once, after the first ngOnChanges(). ngOnInit() is still called even when ngOnChanges() is not (which is the case when there are no template-bound inputs).                                                                                     |
| **ngOnDestroy()**           | Cleanup just before Angular destroys the directive or component. Unsubscribe Observables and detach event handlers to avoid memory leaks. See details in Cleaning up on instance destruction in this document.                                                                                                         | Called immediately before Angular destroys the directive or component.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **ngOnChanges()**           | Respond when Angular sets or resets data-bound input properties. The method receives a SimpleChanges object of current and previous property values. NOTE: This happens frequently, so any operation you perform here impacts performance significantly. See details in Using change detection hooks in this document. | Called before ngOnInit() (if the component has bound inputs) and whenever one or more data-bound input properties change. NOTE: If your component has no inputs or you use it without providing any inputs, the framework will not call ngOnChanges(). |
| **ngDoCheck()**             | Detect and act upon changes that Angular can't or won't detect on its own. See details and example in Defining custom change detection in this document.                                                                                                                                                               | Called immediately after ngOnChanges() on every change detection run, and immediately after ngOnInit() on the first run.                                                                                                                               |
| **ngAfterViewInit()**       | Respond after Angular initializes the component's views and child views, or the view that contains the directive. See details and example in Responding to view changes in this document.                                                                                                                              | Called once after the first ngAfterContentChecked().                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **ngAfterViewChecked()**    | Respond after Angular checks the component's views and child views, or the view that contains the directive.                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Called after the ngAfterViewInit() and every subsequent ngAfterContentChecked().                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **ngAfterContentInit()**    | Respond after Angular projects external content into the component's view, or into the view that a directive is in. See details and example in Responding to changes in content in this document.                                                                                                                      | Called once after the first ngDoCheck().                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **ngAfterContentChecked()** | Respond after Angular checks the content projected into the directive or component. See details and example in Responding to projected content changes in this document.                                                                                                                                               | Called after ngAfterContentInit() and every subsequent ngDoCheck().                                                                                                                                                                                    |
