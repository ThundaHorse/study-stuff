# Testing an API

---

What is API Testing?

- It's a type of testing that performs verifications at an API level.
- It's part of Integration testing that determines whether the API(s) meet the expectations of functionality, reliability, performance, and security.
  - It differs from UI testing in that it is performed at the *message layer* without a GUI (Graphical User Interface).
