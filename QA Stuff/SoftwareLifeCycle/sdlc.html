        Process used by the software industry to design, develop and test high
        quality softwares. The SDLC aims to produce a high-quality software that
        meets or exceeds customer expectations, reaches completion within times
        and cost estimates.

            SDLC is a framework defining tasks performed at each step in the
            software development process. ISO/IEC 12207 is an international
            standard for software life-cycle processes. It aims to be the
            standard that defines all the tasks required for developing and
            maintaining software.

            SDLC is a process, it consists of a detailed plans describing how to
            develop, maintain, replace and alter or enhance specific software.
            The life cycle defines a methodology for improving the quality of
            software and the overall development process.

            <li>Planning and Requirement Analysis</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The most important and fundamental stage in SDLC. It is
                performed by the senior members of the team with inputs from the
                customer, the sales department, market surveys and domain
                experts in the industry. This information is then used to plan
                the basic project approach and to conduct product feasibility
                study in the economical, operational and technical areas.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Defining Requirements</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                clearly define and document the product requirements and get
                them approved from the customer or the market analysts. This is
                done through an SRS (Software Requirement Specification)
                document which consists of all the product requirements to be
                designed and developed during the project life cycle.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Designing the Product Architecture</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                A design approach clearly defines all the architectural modules
                of the product along with its communication and data flow
                representation with the external and third party modules (if
                any). The internal design of all the modules of the proposed
                architecture should be clearly defined with the minutest of the
                details in DDS.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Building or Developing the Product</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Developers must follow the coding guidelines defined by their
                organization and programming tools like compilers, interpreters,
                debuggers, etc. are used to generate the code.
              </li>
              <li>
                The programming language is chosen with respect to the type of
                software being developed.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Testing the Product</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Usually a subset of all the stages as in the modern SDLC models,
                the testing activities are mostly involved in all the stages of
                SDLC.
              </li>
              <li>
                This stage refers to the testing only stage of the product where
                product defects are reported, tracked, fixed and retested, until
                the product reaches the quality standards defined in the SRS.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Deployment in the Market and Maintenance</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Once the product is tested and ready to be deployed it is
                released formally in the appropriate market. Sometimes product
                deployment happens in stages as per the business strategy of
                that organization. The product may first be released in a
                limited segment and tested in the real business environment
                (UAT- User acceptance testing). Then based on the feedback, the
                product may be released as it is or with suggested enhancements
                in the targeting market segment. After the product is released
                in the market, its maintenance is done for the existing customer
                base.

          <p>
            There are various software development life cycle models defined and
            designed which are followed during the software development process.
            These models are also referred as Software Development Process
            Models". Each process model follows a Series of steps unique to its
            type to ensure success in the process of software development.
